Http Mock Router now features a new shorthand method to override mocks with custom metadata:

Previously:
```apex
Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, HttpMocks.config()
    .overrideMock('SF_REST_Query', HttpMocks.config('SF_REST_Query_Empty')));
```

Now becomes:
```apex
Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, HttpMocks.config()
    .overrideMock('SF_REST_Query', 'SF_REST_Query_Empty'));
```

Also, HttpMocks has 2 new methods that will give you access to handled HttpRequests and returned HttpResponses:
```apex
/**
 * @return List of handled HttpRequests in the order they were issued.
 */
public static List<HttpRequest> getRequests();

/**
 * @return List of returned HttpResponses in order they were returned.
 */
public static List<HttpResponse> getResponses();
```
