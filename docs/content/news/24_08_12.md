A few small improvements for the Query framework and supplementing Mock utility methods to mock relationships and readonly fields.


### Query 2.1.0
[Link to Query framework](/apex/query)

- `orderBy` can now be called multiple times to order by many fields
```apex
Query.Accounts
    .orderBy(Account.CreatedDate)
    .orderBy(Account.OwnerId)
    .getList();

// ORDER BY CreatedDate, OwnerId
```
- Added better support for SObjectFields parameters for commonly used methods. Also, added [KDD](/apex/query) to documentation
  why String remains as baseline parameter.
```apex
Query.Accounts
    .withFields(new List<SObjectField>{
        Account.Id,
        Account.Name,
        Account.CreatedDate
    });
```

Also, kindly remainder, that you can easily convert any sObjectField token into a string API Name as follows:
```apex
'' + Account.Name;
Account.Name.toString();
String.valueOf(Account.Name);
```

### Mock 1.1.0
[Link to Mock utility](/apex/mock)
- Added new methods to mock sobjects, which can be used to mock formula fields, readonly fields, and relationships:
```apex
List<Account> accounts = Mock.sObjects(Account.SObjectType, new List<Map<String, Object>>{
    new Map<String, Object>{
        '' + Account.Name => 'Test',

        'CreatedBy' => new User(
            LastName = 'Test User'
        ),

        'Contacts' => new List<Contact>{
            new Contact(
                LastName = 'Test Contact'
            )
        }
    }
});
```
